## About Study Portal

The idea behind Study Portal is to have one platform where students are able to work together on work where other people are doing similar subjects and help each other out.

## My goal and original idea

**Extracted from my [blog post](https://blog.willthedeveloper.co.uk/2022/02/20/an-ecosystem-for-students.html)**

Before we get into the nitty gritty of the project and my plans for the future, I first wanted to give a little back-story to how the idea came about and the situation that I was in at the time that I had come up with the idea. I am going to assume that you know nothing about me so I will make sure to leave some pointers. During my time at college, I had to do a work placement and I had actually decided to take part of a work placement where we was all told that it was going to be really difficult, well long story short, it started with 12 people and finished with 2, including myself. During that project, I got exposed to Laravel which is an entire different story and quite a steep learning curve since I had never worked with any frameworks before. You can read about my experience with laravel up to yet [here](https://blog.willthedeveloper.co.uk/2022/02/13/laravel-one-year-later.html).

Anyway, if we fast forward 12 months, I am finishing my work placement with over 700 hours of industry experience in the bag. At the time of writing this I can't remember what triggered it but I had this idea to create a platform that allowed students to work together in one way or another. Teams is cool but I feel like it's tailored more towards a business environment compared to a student environment which is one of the problems I was aiming to solve by developing this application.

But, long explaination, cut short, my primary goals were as follows;

-   Create a platform that students could work together in some way to get work done more effeciently.
-   Enable collaboration accross all levels of study, ranging from college to universtity.
-   Implement additional tools that other applications don't have to ensure that it tailors for students.
-   Have something that is open source so it can be developed over a long time.

## Study Portal features

_Tick means it has been finished_

## How to install/run server

Install composer packages

```
composer install
```

Install NPM packages

```
npm install
```

To set the APP_KEY value in your .env file run the following command:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

If you have setup the .ENV then run the migrations command:

```
php artisan migrate
```

Run the server

```
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

_You may get an error about a missing .env file which I do not source control since it has credentials in it._

## Versioning

This repository follows semantic versioning: MAJOR . MINOR . PATCH.

The versioning has been introduced into the repository a bit late but has now been implemented and will be used from now on.

-   [x] Alpha (Not part of versioning)
-   [ ] Beta (Currently in Beta)
-   [ ] Public Beta Testing
-   [ ] Initial release (Date TBD)

## Testing

Testing should be completed and successful before accepting any pull requests into the repository.

Tests can be run via the command line using the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
php artisan test
```

Tests can be located inside `/tests/feature/` directory.

## Notifications

Study Portal will have a lot of cross application notification integration that initially will be heavily based around JSON webhooks.

Below are a list of methods that you will be able to receive notifications:

-   [ ] Microsoft Teams - This has been requested upon some feedback that I received and made it clear that it would be quite a good idea and an alternative way to get into contact with students regarding any new assignments that they may have.
-   [ ] Email - This would be one of the main ways of notifying students of updates on the platform that would be targetted towards them.
-   [ ] Text message - I aim for this to be one of the other notifying channels that most of the students would use since I am assumuming that most students would have phones that they can check when they get a notification.
-   [x] Discord - This is the main notification channel for testing initially but could be used on a wider scope on a per person basis but would require webhook relationships with users which is not a thing yet. Further investigation is required for this.
-   [ ] Twitter - This might not make it to the final release since I cannot see it being used.

_Suggestions are welcome for other notification channels but would need some sort of justification._

## Issue tracking

_I am still yet to create the templates for issues_

## What does it look like at the moment?

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT THE FINAL DESIGN AND IS SUBJECT FOR A OVERHAUL REDESIGN AND IS JUST SHOWING A CONCEPT**

Here are some images of the fundamental structure of the application at the minute.

### Student Dashboard

**UPDATE - THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY HAVING AN HEAVY REDESIGN**

You can preview this redesign on a different branch linked here - https://github.com/WillTheDeveloper/StudyPortal/tree/redesigned-backend

On this page, students will be able to get an overview of what is happening. Here they will be able to view an overview of key flags for that individual, which will include things such as the students attendance etc. Additionally, other information will be available here such as updates or notifications that the student may recieve regarding anything that they may need updating on, such as assignment updates etc.

### Student Timetable

This is where students will be able to view their timetables and edit them if they need to. They will also be able to create their own if they have not been assigned one. **This image is due for an update as this has changed a lot.** Here they will be able to manage and view their timetable for the week. They will be able to click on the slot that they want to query and view extra information about it. I am also going to link the timetable to assigments so when they view it or look at the details, assignment pointers can be found there too as a subtle reminder.

### Student Assignments

This is where students will be able to view all the assignments they have. Which will be followed by an image of where students can view their assignment details. Here they are able to view details of assignments that tutors or staff have assigned to them. They will be able to hand in work and tutors will be able to see this on their own dashboard interface.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78596837/144643958-f0054008-a4eb-468e-a242-bb3586da5328.png)

### Student Kanban (New feature)

This is where students will be able to create their own kanban boards to allow them to organise tasks and work into groups for themselves. The idea behind this is to support them by giving them a tool where they can possibly time manage their tasks and other things they are doing by adding their own tasks and syncing it with assignments. Additional information will be able to be viewed when clicking on the task that you create. These tasks can be associated with other things such as subjects and assignments if they felt it was nessasary. In the future, these will be sharable with other people with set permissions on each.

Details view of the kanban board. **Still in early development.**

### Student Community

This is where students will be able to collaborate on work and ask each other things related to their own subjects.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78596837/144644088-b891c412-3ad7-45d5-9ba0-10c6cd6c724b.png)

### Regarding tutors

In regard to tutor, the views will be similar with additional functionality. There are security measures in place to ensure that there is no access from a student to tutors tools.

### Tutors Group Management

On this page, tutors can create groups of students which could be different classes or such. Groups are groups of students that can be chosen to assign assignments to be tutors, this will be shown further down.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78596837/141193329-c4173e52-628b-46d0-a156-09fbc4f964b9.png)

This is where tutors can view who is in the group and edit anything they need to edit regarding the group.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78596837/141193570-1793e005-8623-4854-a01e-087584e5c51c.png)

Here is where tutors can select different students to add to the group.

### Tutors Assignment Management

Tutors will have additional options to assign work to students, this is where they will do it. Which can be located inside the assignments tab in the navigation bar.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78596837/141193793-9318ce3e-d6a4-4337-8331-909693797db5.png)

Finally, tutors can see who has seen the assignment and when they have submitted the students work along with editing the assignment information.
